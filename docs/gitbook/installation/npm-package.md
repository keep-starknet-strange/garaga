## Building the package from source code

The package can be build directly from source code by cloning the garaga repository. Make sure you have both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed in you machine.
