# Installation

You can use garaga in different ways, for different use cases. \
\- The [developer-setup-and-guides](../developer-setup-and-guides/ "mention") explains how to setup a dev environment for contributing to garaga and as well as some tutorials.\
\- The [python-package.md](python-package.md "mention")is the way to generate Cairo SNARKS verifiers, deploy them to Starknet, and call your contract from the command line, using the Garaga CLI.\
\- The [rust-crate.md](rust-crate.md "mention") \
\- The [npm-package.md](npm-package.md "mention") (essentially wasm code generated from the Rust crate) provides tooling to dApps developers to convert proofs to calldata and interact with browser wallets.
