# Installation

You can use garaga in different ways, for different use cases. \
\- The [developer-setup.md](developer-setup.md "mention") allows you to contribute to garaga and use the Garaga CLI.\
\- The [python-package.md](python-package.md "mention")is the easiest way to generate SNARKS verifiers, deploy them to Starknet, and call you contract from the command line, using the Garaga CLI.\
\- The [npm-package.md](npm-package.md "mention") (soon available) provides tooling to dApps developers to convert proofs to calldata and interact with browser wallets.
