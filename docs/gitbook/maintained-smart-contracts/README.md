# Maintained Smart Contracts

We declare & maintain Smart Contracts for the community so they can be used as library calls.

\
Those contracts:

* Are _declared_ **both** Starknet Sepolia **and** Mainnet.
* Those contracts are re-deployed at each release, so their code correspond to the release commit.
* The source code is always available in the main garaga repository under `src/contracts`
* The contracts are only declared and not deployed, their expected usage is through [library syscalls.](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch15-03-executing-code-from-another-class.html#library-calls), so their usage is done through their class hashes and not their contract address (which don't exist unless you deploy them yourself)

### Class hashes for Garaga v0.18.1.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you need to obtain class hashes for different versions of garaga or declare them yourself if they do not exist, you can checkout garaga repo at a particular commit and run `python .github/scripts/declare_maintained_contracts.py` or `python .github/scripts/verify_contracts.py`\
\
At each release tag, the CI ensure all contracts are declared before publishing packages.&#x20;
