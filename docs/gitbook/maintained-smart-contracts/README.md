# Maintained Smart Contracts

We declare & maintain Smart Contracts for the community so they can be used as library calls.

\
Those contracts:

* Are _declared_ both Starknet Sepolia and Mainnet.
* Those contracts are re-deployed at each release, so their code correspond to the release commit.
* The source code is always available in the main garaga repository under `src/contracts`
* The contracts are only declared and not deployed, their expected usage is through [library syscalls.](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch15-03-executing-code-from-another-class.html#library-calls), their usage is done through their class hashes.\
