# SP1

To use the SP1 Groth16 verifier on Starknet, you can follow code snippets from the [SP1 documentation](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/introduction) to generate a proof.\
\
The version of SP1 expected by Garaga is defined in the file [constants.json](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/garaga/blob/main/tools/make/constants.json) .\
\
A template modeled after [Succinct's official one](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/) for solidity and EVM is available in [this repository](https://github.com/feltroidprime/SP1-starknet-garaga-template/)\
Please follow the instructions there to get you started.&#x20;
