# SP1

To use SP1 groth16 verifier on Starknet, you can follow code snippets from SP1 documentation to generate a proof. \
\
The version of SP1 expected by garaga is defined in the file [constants.json](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/garaga/blob/main/tools/make/constants.json) . \
\
Here's a minimal snippet to show the flow. \
\
A template mimicking the [official Succinct's one](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/) for solidity and EVM is available in [this repository ](https://github.com/feltroidprime/SP1-starknet-garaga-template/)\
Please follow the instructions there. \
