# Development cycle improvements

This work starts from PR 521. It preserves that PR's Cairo, Python, and runtime compatibility decisions.

## CI dependency coverage

Node tests consume proof fixtures outside `tools/`. WASM builds consume the root Cargo manifests, lockfile, and configuration.
The setup smoke test consumes Python dependencies, Rust sources, and the Python package.
Each workflow now includes those inputs in its path filters.

The path regression suite failed for 18 dependency-change cases before this change.
All 34 cases now pass, including unrelated documentation changes that still skip these workflows.
The package README remains a setup input because maturin reads it during the native build.
The existing test jobs, release conditions, and matrices remain unchanged.

Run the regression suite:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/hydra/test_workflow_paths.py
```
